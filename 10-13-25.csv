For tracking purposes from one of the members of DuPage RRT
I happened to be very near the Lombard facility on 22nd st so I drove through the parking lot about 4:35. This guy was pulling out as I was leaving. No hard evidence, but here are my suspicions (1) He was driving like law enforcement (no turn signal, speeding, turning on “orange” lights) and (2) this license plate is suspicious. Since 2017 IL has been issuing license plates that are 2 letters followed by 5 numbers. Prior to that it was xxx xxxx format - all numbers. His license plate is 6 digits only.

Yes PASO responded to this one after being notified by folks in Maywood. I got there shortly after 2 pm but missed the activity.

This is at a school in our coverage area. Did the detention take place at the school? Can we get follow-up contact info for the teacher?

Following up on this FSN call that came in yesterday afternoon at 85th & Ingleside. Do we have contact info to follow up with the teacher who reported it?

The far south side team really wants to figure out what happened and help set a safety plan, if we can get in touch with them and it turns out the abduction happened right at/near the school.

My team is still seeking more information about this. We asked whether the teacher was contactable when the report first came in, but I'm guessing our question got lost in the chat.

Do FSN people have any more information about this report that can be shared so our team can contact the teacher and find out more about what happened, and what supports might be needed for impacted families?","8505 S Ingleside Ave, Chicago, IL 60619","ICE Sighting,Public Space Raid",,,Other,,,Alexa H,,,,,,,FSN,,,10/11/2025 3:06am

PASO RRT Responding

Fsn: ice sighting @ the Rush Oakpark E.R. 4 masked agents in tan cameo uniform brought in a patient to the Hospital there.

Confirmed one person currently at Rush Oak Park ER and ICE has come in to remove and detain that person brought in by CPD. Responders on the ground. Oak Park police also on site. Seeking more information as I believe this may be tied to a case in NWS  ?

PASO RRT: Someone in the inside of the hospital who will need to remain anonymous to protect their job has spoken to the Director of ER - it seems the person was taken by ICE (possibly from workplace but we are unsure) and is a documented US citizen. ICE agents in masks forced their way into the ER and violated the Hospital protocols. No ICE presence in the building at this time. Person has been released and is no longer there. It also appears the Tribune has gotten a statement from the Hospital so we might need help from @Brandon Lee to corroborate, as the statement the Tribune had suggested the person was at a demonstration and that is where ICE picked him up

⁨🎥⁩ ⁨PASO RRT additional update: attaching video of Rush Oak Park encounter with ICE agents and holding to their protocols despite threats from ice goons. 4 cars involved also attached. Unconfirmed report the initial abduction of USC happened in Forest Park at Concordia cemetery, expect to have verification tomorrow.     Plates:                  Dodge Durango XH9 V5U Missouri plate

Ice sighting. Could not get a good address they just said that they took a wrong turn by an old steel mill in calumet park and saw a lot of Ice agents and cars there.

I think this is referring to the old South Works site on the southeast side, just north of Calumet Park and east of South Shore Drive in the 80s.

It could also refer to Calumet Park the suburb, located between my team and @[Blue Island], but I'm not aware of an old steel mill there.

Sent to team there’s a couple of old mill places

There’s some abandoned warehouses near wood and 126 I can take a peak there. I’m not sure of a mill either

The warehouses are clear. 

Any idea of where else I should check?

It's tough to say. There were so many steel plants that used to be active in the area. I think most likely the FSN call was referring to the old US Steel South Works site or the old Republic Steel site, which are both in the southeast side team's coverage area, so you might be good now.

SE RRT went to the old mill on 83rd and it was clear.

There is a white pick up from a landscaping business. And some CPD horses parked in our area currently. No ICE.","3365-3399 E 83rd St, Chicago, IL 60617","ICE Sighting,Rumors",,,"Blue Island,South East Side / 10th ward",,,Alexa H,,,,,,,FSN,,,10/11/2025 1:40am

^from the unvetted sw chat

Our member is there now and I’m on my way.

Just leaving EP, can head that way to assist. I’m by 111/cicero rn

Here now too. @[redacted] I’m in a white VW. Per the call in EP, multiple agents in 7 vehicles total. I have a feeling it’s the same agents

Update to this - My RRT member is really shaken up. He said he was in the lot and 4 agents got out of the car and approached him and his friend and asked them questions about papers. They approached his friend first who was responding and he cut it off. They moved more north/east on SW HWY.

Keep us posted on how to support, sending big hugs to your crew

They’re turning on 69th/Pulaski going west.  - SW Suburbs starting to get close to your area
We lost them going west because we had a feeling they wanted to trap us on a small street. Think they’re going eventually go back on Pulaski.

Person on the ground. These are behind Dollar Tree at Damen Plaza (photos uploaded)
please have them be careful. They approached one of ours very closely & took pic/vids of them
From LVSD members at discount mall:
“We're told they went to Pulaski so we're going there. The guys at the mall said 2 people were taken. They locked the doors so ice didn't get in”

Confirmed ICE Arrests of People Experiencing Homelessness in Logan Square this week:
During CCH's street outreach today, we confirmed with various people experiencing homelessness in Logan Square that ICE raids have occurred this week that have targeted + (at least in one instance) resulted in arrests of unhoused individuals. 

The first individual we spoke with shared that four people he was with were taken by ICE near Belmont & Kimball. Agents released him when he presented his ID. He said this happened within the last few days. 

Then, others we encountered at the close-by Shell gas station located at 3181 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL 60618 confirmed that there was an ICE raid yesterday. Those we spoke with scattered when ICE arrived, and we are not sure if they detained anyone then. We provided transit assistance and guidance to those interested in accessing shelter that we spoke with. 

We believe these are the first confirmed arrests of people experiencing homelessness in Chicago that we have been able to verify with witnesses firsthand.

RR Member: Caution: 18 agents and more arriving told ppl if they didnt leave they where gonna start shooting

PASO RRT: Here is what we know from our responder and Cristobal Cavazos and Ruby from Casa DuPage / People’s Patrol who just debriefed with me via phone:

It appears that there was a warrant being served by ICE with a federal judicial warrant
15-20 agents from ICE
One person was taken - Casa DuPage is getting personal information (Lisa Rogers is the lead in Bensenville)

Bensenville PD might have been there to aid but we don’t have enough details. Casa Du Page responded and by the time they got there were barricades (likely put up by Bensenville PD) and at that point Casa DuPage people were threatened that they would be shot at.

Information has been passed on to Rep Hernandez who is working with Congresswoman Ramirez’s office on this. From what they describe it did sound like BPD collaborating with ICE - they will be working to identify person and see if there was more information regarding TRUST act violations

Three of our team members arrived after the action - it’s a stretch for PASO RRT to respond rapidly into Bensenville, even for our Melrose Park residents.

Update from the family: The man was being followed from the Blackhawk apartments in Elgin. He noticed they were following him so he pulled over his vehicle before the entrance to the highway and ran on foot. He called his family and his family was able to find him and help recover the vehicle before any arrest was made. Agents must have been waiting near the vehicle to see where it would be taken to.

3:05pm Being reported behind the Food for Less- they are moving through the plaza by cermak/cicero
3:10pm White helicopter coming north just over Pullman
We are hearing they arrested a family /holding someone with a child. RR team is present and there is 15 agents
3:24pm Is that Bovino participating in the arrest? Looks like it to me.
3:10pm There is ice by the Cicero east Rr is on their way to the school only half a mile from Walmart
3:35pm One of our members in Cicero just got threatened with arrest and they threw tear gas at her. ICE is still active in the Cicero Ave/31st area
3:41pm Cicero team needs backup: ICE is circling an elementary school Cicero East on 49th and 23rd Place, team is out there with megaphone. ICE is also going back to the stores: Home Depot, Walmart, Food For Less along Cicero Avenue and 31st (note: creating another report for the school)
3:47pm FSN Voicemail left at 3:47pm Ice just came out of Sam’s club parking lot in Cicero IL on 26th st. They were driving a grey Toyota 4Runner license 
4:01pm Sorry, y'all things are hectic...since our team is at the school support would be best at the stores mentioned in case they come back. We got someone on way to Sams Club but no one at the Food For Less, Walmart or Home Depot. Someone just went to Menards and all clear
4:15pm FSN: Ice sighting, 2803 S. Ave. Inside of the Sam's Club, in Cicero Plaza. Reported as currently making arrests. Unmarked trucks, 6 to 12 agents wearing masks. Wearing olive green tactical uniforms that say ICE.
4:30pm: Walmart employee witnessed it and confirmed they took someone here. Security on duty helped detain the guy according to him...Male, light Hispanic, 35-50yrs old
4:37pm: Verified. Cicero. 48th Ct & 31st. Worker at corner auto shop said a white truck kept circling and detained 1 person about an hour and 20 minutes ago then went to Panda Express
4:42pm Team on ground verified that all agents left from Sam’s/food for less/ Home Depot lot. RRT is canvassing to gather info
4:49pm: Yes that'd be helpful. No one's been able to share a video so far. Spoke to manager, she witnessed all of it according to employees, but she said she couldn't talk about it due to company protocols. I pushed and learned that it's possible wife and daughter were also taken and she mentioned it might be an employee that was off duty, but they are also working on trying to figure out who it was. Quick look around and they definitely have cameras up front, could be a pressure point. It happened right by the market side entrance, between the two sets of sliding doors. Employee I spoke to said he heard a crash and looked over and saw the guy was being pinned to the glass
5:05pm: It would be interesting to know what are the Walmart “protocols” given the security guard helped them in the detention.","3320 S Cicero Ave, Cicero, IL 60804","ICE Sighting,Public Space Raid",,,"Chicago SWS,Cicero/Berwyn,Pilsen,Little Village",1,checked,CE,,"Ford Explorer, Grey, Illinois Plates

Popeyes employees and city workers nearby confirmed they saw agents going after a man at the intersection. He fled on foot and the car was left behind on street. Someone moved it to Popeyes parking lot before RRT arrived. Car was still on, Popeyes employees confirmed they will not call a tow on the car. Since he fled on foot, we are unsure is a detainment was made. We left the car and key at the Popeyes in case he managed to flee and needs to get back home. Address and name found in car was for Uptown. SW team can help getting the car moved to Uptown, but would appreciate help getting in contact with family from Uptown team.

RRT Followup: Was unable to confirm this. Neighbors didn't see it, but the people who were outside when I arrived were not outside at the time of the incident. Too many black SUVs around for me to confirm the car of the people reported taken or to randomly try door handles.

Update:
CPD showed up. we weren’t able to get the name of the person. And now cpd calling in for towing because it’s suspended -_-

wondering if someone could go to the block the car is registered to and go door to door?

Car has a residential sticker #1811, which is 5300 - 5359 W Drummond Pl

Closest would be Hyde Park - @Mari and crew

There's a couple big lakefront residential complexes in that area, though, so it may be hard to find somebody who knows the car or its owner

Will send to HP team

Apologies, 
That address was for city parking not residential permit parking.

that's the extent of the info so far

FSS checked

thank you @<redacted> (FSS), I asked about cars and whether they are still in the area. Will report back

Not seeing anything here and court security says they didn't see anything, but the parking lot is out of their sight so it's possible something took place out there. There's a transport van here that's used by the court system, but no other obviously suspicious vehicles. If we get more info, that might be helpful.

I can confirm this occurred. Our attorneys spoke to the Sheriffs who observed but no public defender staff saw this. They were gone when we got out there. We will try to identify the person taken based on who was due in court and is missing.
the person was taken inside the court building in the lobby on their way to court.

My understanding is that the court entrance in question is on the west side of the semi-enclosed courtyard across from the entrance to the police station in the same building. Is that correct, or is there a different lobby my team should have eyes on?

I don't have that info but can get it shortly. I am not sure if there is a need for RRT to stay. As far as we can tell, all court abductions have been targeted and the agents have left as soon as they get their person or if they determine that person hasn't come. And our staff said they left immediately (fwiw). Though I did hear about a collateral arrest inside the Will County courthouse.

We're no longer on site right now, just thinking about future plans if we get enough capacity to observe from the courtyard on good weather days or something like that. Feel free to DM me once you know more specifics about the location in the building where this happened.","727 E 111th St, Chicago, IL 60628","ICE Sighting,Rumors",,,Other,,,Alexa Herrera,,,,,,,RRT,,,9/26/2025 1:58am

from FB to our RRT page: sent 2 mins ago. They are currently on 68th between Ashland and marsh field next to family dollar. They have a man in a white work van
Video submitted Team member reports 2 police cars on Ashland. team member reports a blue ford expedition and another team member states that same car has been terrorizing SW. states that he saw agent go from the blue ford to the silver ford and agent took his plate number down. Reports a helicopter in view east of him.
person responding states van is still there and locked and both vehicles are in family dollar lot 68 & Ashland. will avoid driving by lot as agents have seen him circling and have his plate. Magnet school (Miles Davis) at 68 west of Marshfield. Talked to neighbor who will try to ID the van for neighbors to see if anyone knows him/them. Gave KYR card. reports that silver vehicle took pics of him in the car. BOTY team sending help. Person initially detained was let go as he was a citizen. team believes they were asked to leave the parking lot at family dollar, bc they moved the two cars to 68th just before Miguel arrived/ Then multiple other vehicles arrived. For one guy, who is a citizen. Christopher (detainee) told Miguel that they had two Venezuelan brothers in the car prior to him being detained. They seemed to follow him over for no reason (Miguel may have more info on this). The neighbor who he spoke to had walked east down 68th and saw something was wrong. She went west and warned her neighbors that ICE was around, which may be why team didn't see anyone out. She was on her way back when they spoke. Gave her a bit of info and a card. She documented the truck and the card and posted on FB. That's why his family showed up as they were letting him go. Two white folks, male and female spoke with Christopher. He said they were Homeland Security. Maybe bc he was a citizen and then they showed up to clean it all up, note sure. All he can say is they seemed kind (we thought they were attorneys). They can be seen on Miguels video.",68th and Ashland,ICE Sighting,,,Chicago SWS,,checked,Jo Ann,,"Blue Ford Expedition Texas plate RFP 5294.

 Additional Information: The man is inside the court house and confirmed to our lawyer that he is ICE (picture within files below).  Attorney onsite is alerting PD’s in felony room, and her folks that ICE is onsite.

Can't stick around - @Sara-Blue Island Robbins, is there somebody you can send to have eyes on them?

It was a White Ford Explorer, plates started with ER 42...

Could just be somebody with an Explorer that looks similar to a police vehicle, since there weren't others visible nearby, but figured I'd be cautious since a white Explorer with regular IL plates beginning in ER was part of a group of agents the far south side team responded to a few days ago

All clear they prob were u-turning. I drove around a couple of times and another car u turned there. I’m going to drive around both communities just to make sure and team is also aware.

2:34pm: 115th & Forest, all standard Illinois plates, claimed ""we're not ICE"" but they have mostly generic police vests and one in a Marshalls vest. They took photos of our team from afar after we questioned them. We're not leaving, keeping eyes on them.

Another video was sent at 12:53

Update on 115th & Forest: agents left around 1PM. They were aware that they were being observed by multiple community members. Several of our responders were photographed from afar by the agents, and when the agents left they split up to avoid being tailed. One sped the wrong way up a one-way street.

A local panaderia across the street was closed for two hours in the middle of this incident, and a nearby school was on high alert.

We believe that the van seen in Dawn Marie's video is unrelated to this incident. It had already left by the time our rapid responders arrived, and the funeral home owner says an inmate was visiting a family member who had passed around that time. The four agents at the back of the lot don't appear to have interacted with the van or its occupants, who wore different uniforms and had a logo on their vehicle.",115th west of Kensington Station,ICE Sighting,,,Pullman,,checked,CE,,"White, ER98941",ER98941,,,ER98941,External,"9AED78B5-4663-47C8-8F7A-75FFD3135571.mp4 (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/ydh2GZdWp5yC99xqKEBgww/__2pT3EByIJmh6y1h7kgSohN3PEupwwmmhfefNDZt8LhjpgPkEhuoZXlORWgNlxeU2Hld0dLvbNrMZpZRMB2Fldt10Rf93A51JeYe8fxu56eXaz3IyYLj551I3o8EjUR0mN3PlIyg1w6QoMH8o3VTVB5ekuQv2Mo3fayBhMEFU-yH8osEyjMs_KtKoZWmZ8i/AQxuTNa6StWYriWycfHHOeoTBtdTp96fh8PM6aX4C50),IMG_4753.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/ifQHPUkCeuG2ZBSylpmq-w/5wcI6ypni3E2l8-EQFEPtrnD6JM7-wDkzO6BLom__yUASlSyoN7Z7QahvMlyPMa9egOmS0wlF57hsmcs_F5QoqWmIqqFLIneZvSs6Tz2VjJ-CFPHfG5axLyZ2Oo6yGISV6BIgRdcI_OXyyn2MDed8yjeAH1hV3WNqe5TZCjjZIU/YfVlGIKyJ1YYK6snMzjVhZoXkNds-ISluMn4lg5xy8c),IMG_4750.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/PTKjX9FHmVGHq5zJJauPsw/RDDCjrjbn-sx_64ZHqtMGVBx0fpNxk00RP1gfY_5ngmVuHJ3byOE01XDJA952eSbjtLe03wrvbHHGPoiLRIVpYDFyrFaOWG2eFR0HJmL1qx6aKpB7kKf22lpValjDD03OsKpHCxsk0Lwr5uGNVyICSLusSk2-8CoMWxGVKxFlYw/lzS59Cgz6iz-zrRcfESMKYT9-P33lQ23w6ipNQN8ee8),IMG_4749.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/zsgZzrqbc8wFiLPhYpmrwQ/HtOkPqgqNW7PdQ1b5FXY6yFWhbRiL4rlCxY2WJRhy3dgHKfPutD7qX9aiXx3L1DCUUaRqBpLpMi4h9eBpsgSMe0439c2z6yzfz5Sy-y78WVkkZiLirxQB2AOwN1zrXV40Kxy2k1glFl58Mtn0KhQNld1Q-l_165Q_0D9y96lRmE/Sk-a4z59wBtH-ak_3B_Ew2g1c504bwcqwrXguUxYMtU),signal-2025-09-19-121012.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/0Ji9Ob3Tpv5Y8wD04OtjRg/C8AIk8dWaIuUnMOWEz65SURJ5qVu3ewTaTSRMQqmk1HxF52rrdLxNvyE2e0BQVXuv6ba2Z2uY6QSXASlBHjvMMurG5k17seX8-sODDPtgxiJ0EhmXvQLjq8886_SOqYhZyTClIeapEipU8CKLYojTNortmcGsuYPZJBenRwsZJJHKoBeTLEiKyywwNZBQVVa/fQd__oek76byiymjb25vwOyDHkAlV6jP8ZKW2PTpuDs),F3A082B3-2681-4EEE-9019-3DE86A482964.mp4 (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/B6-lcyhlLIZqDCWexfg8NA/sU9bYSMFIEWZob84qyiRI0Onl9m6L848prmy0l1qhqRQazJoWxg-fr2uvUALgwZfw2rjFJYO4l6CdQbpD_yx6THactDayr4oTKOaz2gt89s5DBoJcrHIdUcncdc4X6wFMzk03s5XPagtcnTLEB6yAkCR5iVKZ1Aha1Ds6U0WovnxXRYkbgStMUhufD13K1lX/6pvTgYRra3jr_a5ScNr-U1EyeQgznIwVBFbua28iQNA),signal-2025-09-19-114348_002.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1760400000000/B3GlRB3JEvIbsdCrUFPScg/3fqPXSrQrE3hs9nbjkH8IGI7WEQxAFRkXzbTaF8Zp0uSUmDqNLkfNCGXidwWkLJRFGt44WV1kobMKdwfZ4PFDGYfOfB50Jq_ATet6CjiPK7Nesk2n68WV14cm-xlrDwnvn3aUrGT6c5UP9Bs60a2KtnOEJTKeqKpMF7hUps3ns39KY_R_2bmGRpGdUXsyfMc/mf6ssRJ1FapcvjSHCop_CiMcwEMDqYM6mNqiqhvhsYA)",🔵 eyJpIjoiMTE1dGggd2VzdCBvZiBLZW5zaW5ndG9uIFN0YXRpb24iLCJvIjp7InN0YXR1cyI6Ik9LIiwiZm9ybWF0dGVkQWRkcmVzcyI6IktlbnNpbmd0b24sIExvbmRvbiwgVUsiLCJsYXQiOjUxLjUwMTAwOTUsImxuZyI6LTAuMTkzMjc5NCwiYmxvY2tJbnN0YWxsYXRpb25JZHMiOlsiYmxpclVYaWw5eWtIS0ZBek4iXSwibG9jYXRpb25GaWVsZElkIjoiZmxkcktTemg4VlhKTTFBa0MifSwiZSI6MTc2MTQwNzY1OTk3OX0=,9/22/2025 1:54am

“ICE just stopped a neighbor on Dobson near Custer, she didn't have her driver's license so they followed her home and made her go get them.

The additional text was sent at 5:07pm on 09/19 - ""This is a follow up from this - a RRT team member who is an attorney followed up with her this afternoon when she was available and she got the full story, sharing here…so far the victim wants to remain anonymous but does want something to be done about it…we are strategizing and welcome input. Here’s what RRT member said:

Hello all, I just spoke with her, very scary encounter and story from her:

She dropped her child off at Oakton Elementary this morning and noticed she was being followed by a black Ford SUV with tinted windows. 

The vehicle followed her to her home - a multi unit rental - and pulled up once she had parked and exited her vehicle (i.e. did not effectuate a traffic stop).

Two officer approached and were wearing dark clothing and bulletproof vests that specified “POLICE.” One of the officers asked her to provide her driver’s license. She told them it was in the mail, as she had just renewed, but assured them it would be valid in any police/DMV system. 

She asked the officers “Did I do anything?” And officers did not provide an answer but asked for ID again. She again assured them it could be looked up on traffic system to verify. They asked if she had any other form of identification to which she responded she had a passport and birth certificate inside her home.

Officers then followed her inside her building and into her apartment unit. Her passport and birth certificate were in her dining room, right in the entry of her home. She provided these documents and the officers inspected them, and asked if anyone else lived there. She told them her son did and provided his birth certificate as well. These documents were readily available in her dining room as she planned to put them in a safety deposit box at the bank. After inspecting these documents, the officers left.

I have advised her on her rights in terms of being stopped outside her home, and constitutional protections that prevent officers warrantless entry into her home. Unfortunately, her allowance into the home - even by way of fear or intimidation - could be considered consent. I also provided information on what she could say and do if this ever happen again - which I certainly hope it does not. It sounds like a very scary interaction and, while we may know our rights or the right things to say, it’s a whole other scenario when faced with unidentified armed officers.

To me, I think local PD would effectuate a traffic stop, rather than wait for her to exit her vehicle - the fact that they didn’t gives me the inkling it could be ICE (because they’re not within their jurisdiction to effectuate a traffic stop). I also do not believe that local PD would so brazenly enter the home, when no articulable criminal circumstances exist, by their own admission. She has concern this could also potentially be vigilantes/non-law enforcement. However, she did not ask what office they were with, or get officers’ names or badge numbers, nor the vehicle license plate. 

I asked her if she needed any additional support to feel safe and supported, she said nothing needed at this time. I told her I would report back to y’all and we would stay in conversation. I also told her, to the extent she is comfortable and has relationships with the other tenants in her building, she should inform them of this encounter and share FSN number.""","Custer Ave & Dobson St, 60202",Rumors,,,Evanston,,checked,CE,,,,,,,External,,🔵 eyJpIjoiQ3VzdGVyIEF2ZSAmIERvYnNvbiBTdCwgNjAyMDIiLCJvIjp7InN0YXR1cyI6Ik9LIiwiZm9ybWF0dGVkQWRkcmVzcyI6IkN1c3RlciBBdmUgJiBEb2Jzb24gU3QsIEV2YW5zdG9uLCBJTCA2MDIwMiwgVVNBIiwibGF0Ijo0Mi4wMjAzMDM4OTk5OTk5OSwibG5nIjotODcuNjgwNDQzNSwiYmxvY2tJbnN0YWxsYXRpb25JZHMiOlsiYmxpclVYaWw5eWtIS0ZBek4iXSwibG9jYXRpb25GaWVsZElkIjoiZmxkcktTemg4VlhKTTFBa0MifSwiZSI6MTc2MTQwODAxOTcxMX0=,9/21/2025 9:58pm

RRT: got this from our member too: Someone reached out to BPNC, will ask for more info and to call FSN (image uploaded with report of ICE entering home at 54th and Francisco)
should we give her a call?.....One of our members can be near, should I connect her to you?
She called and was on hold for like 30 mins. About 10 cars with no plates took him. Green vests and grey, white, black cars. 10–15 agents. Hotline number isn’t answering her.
have a member who contacted, what other info should he get while he's with her?
Additional info collected was sent to Xanat. 
RRT: Talked with a neighbor at 5303 S Francisco. ICE took one person, who rents next door to them (not sympathetic).
Spoke with the neighbor who took one of the videos. The man abducted lives at 5307 S Francisco. His wife was present so knows. She was too afraid to come out earlier when an RRT person tried to talk to her. I don’t have cards with me.

The photos appear to be from behind Ultimate Furniture and Mattress, so safely approaching the folks who live at 7914 Colfax and making clear that you're with RRT (and not ICE) might give you more info, since they probably took the photos. any chance you have direct contact with the people who took the photos?

From Pullman RRT member @ 12:11 pm: ""Updating on this with what we know so far. This was a very chaotic scene. We don't have a clear idea yet what happened. The people who were there when the incident was taking place believe it was ICE, though.Folks from Centro were responding to a tip at the same Home Depot where somebody was taken this morning, on 87th. Somebody told them that agents had left the parking lot, but were behind the property somewhere. Centro volunteers observed agents in unmarked vehicles talking to each other somewhere near the Aldi at 85th & Holland, and found a large active scene of some sort at the Aldi. The scene at the Aldi involved agents in unmarked vehicles and two ambulances. A marked CPD vehicle eventually showed up briefly and left, but it's not clear if they were involved or if they happened upon the scene at random while on patrol. Centro volunteers also think they saw a news photographer there, but that person left quickly. Centro volunteers observed somebody who looked like an agent getting into the passenger compartment of one of the ambulances when it left the scene. There is photo and video, but one of the Centro volunteers' phones is dead, so it might take a little while to gather all the photo/video and figure out what was going on. They're also asking Aldi staff and parking lot security whether they know anything. In the meantime, if anybody has CPD contacts who they can ask to make sure this wasn't a CPD operation, that would be helpful.","200 W 87th Street, Chicago, IL 60620",ICE Sighting,,,Pullman,,checked,Marlyn,,,,,,,"FSN,External",,🔵 eyJpIjoiMjAwIFcgODd0aCBTdHJlZXQsIENoaWNhZ28sIElMIDYwNjIwIiwibyI6eyJzdGF0dXMiOiJPSyIsImZvcm1hdHRlZEFkZHJlc3MiOiIyMDAgVyA4N3RoIFN0LCBDaGljYWdvLCBJTCA2MDYyMCwgVVNBIiwibGF0Ijo0MS43MzcyMDE5LCJsbmciOi04Ny42MzEyMDY2LCJibG9ja0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbklkcyI6WyJibGlyVVhpbDl5a0hLRkF6TiJdLCJsb2NhdGlvbkZpZWxkSWQiOiJmbGRyS1N6aDhWWEpNMUFrQyJ9LCJlIjoxNzYxNDA4MDMyMzk0fQ==,9/18/2025 9:45pm

Border patrol helicopter has been circling around all morning

At 5:50 am today, a group of 40 or 50 men and 20 trucks broke the doors and took three people from a house in Elgin (904 Chippewa Drive ). There were helicopters and drones surrounding the house. One of the enforcement agents said they were border patrol and others were dressed in camouflage but all their clothes and vehicles were unmarked. One of the people arrested was the home owner. One person was a renter so they don't know much about him. The callers are going to continue looking for their A#s and are trying to locate the 3 people. 

Elgin team has been in contact with family members and neighbors.

Blue Island RRT responded, confirmed via photos agents in ERO vests. Photo (attached) and video (https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19YZcAx3QD/) later shared on social media. 

From Blue Island RRT: ""It took place right outside Rosa Parks Middle School, but the school was unaware of it when a team member checked in, so it may not have involved a student's family like the caption said. We aren't sure. We have been unable to locate anybody who knows the person taken, and haven't found the car, but we have photo and video from this morning from multiple people that all lines up. The video has a clear look at some of the agents' vehicles.""

Later summary provided in activity chat:

""The Blue Island team (whose co-lead @Sara Oceguera is now in this chat) initially responded when this came in, and the Far South Side team followed up later. There was one person taken outside the school around 8:00AM, identity unknown. We only know for sure that they were taken because their car was left behind - Sara is trying to call in some favors to get family info from the plates so we can inform them and get them connected to resources. This happened on a busy street before the usual school dropoff rush, so we don't know whether it was actually related to the school, but school administrators were made aware of it by a member of the Blue Island team.

At least four agents, some masked and some unmasked, mostly generic ""POLICE"" vests but at least one ERO vest.

The vehicles involved in the operation were as follows:
White Jeep Grand Cherokee with Indiana plates 266EAW
Navy blue or black Ford Escape (plates unknown)
Black Ford Expedition with Indiana plates B65DAF or B650AF
Black Nissan Titan with Indiana plates [unreadable first character]5480PS

We're in conversation with the team - it's a motorcade
Though this report differs somewhat from what they're seeing on the ground. They've got four black luxury SUVs with IL plates - one MP, three regular. Looks like executive transportation of some sort, for Pritzker or another dignitary.
In any case, they have two team members on site and I'll relay updates from their team if any come.
There's a youth baseball game happening, so it just looks like one of the teams has a senator's kid on it or something. The motorcade is just waiting around, there's two additional agents near the stands, looks like a protective setup rather than immigration related. Will continue to update if there's anything specific we find out, and at least one of the BI team members is sticking around to observe.

Video depicts man being detained. Man says, ""Hey, I have my papers here. They raided Home Depot and I work at Home Depot. I have papers."" Bystander communicates that the detained man is saying he has papers in his bag and ICE agents responds, ""I know."" The detained man identifies himself as Melvin Villega. 2404 N. Cicero is given as an address. Melvin states he has no family members here, and he is from Venezuela. Video depicts masked ICE agent reviewing papers stored in an orange folder (taken from a grey and black backpack he has been holding). Melvin asks bystanders to please let his housemates know he was detained. Melvin sees ICE agent holding the orange folder with documents and asserts again that those are his papers. ""I don't have problems with justice [system], they've never arrested me, I have papers."" Video recorder asks why ICE agents don't have badge numbers and one ICE agent responds, ""We're federal agents, we don't need them."" Masked man keeps searching the backpack. Agent in the background can be heard saying, ""we're by the port of entry, around the airport, 25-mile radius."" Recorder asks where they're taking Melvin to. None of the agents answer the bystander's questions.

From RRT signal chat: N893N is a DHS-owned helicopter that's involved in partnership with various local police agencies. In Chicago, it's often used in conjunction with the local-state-federal Vehicular Hijacking Task Force, used to pursue stolen vehicles when the city's own police helicopters are down for refueling or otherwise unavailable. It is unlikely to be immigration related, since it's been around town for several years in coordination with local police activity. However, because it's a federally controlled helicopter, it's not impossible that it could be reassigned for other tasks, so worth keeping an eye on and probably worth the alder asking police contacts whether they know of a coordinated operation with DHS involving that helicopter today",Going from Blue Island to Racine,Rumors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8/1/2025 6:46pm

Did caller say this was happening at the time of call? Our person on the ground doesn’t see anything but hanging around a bit just in case

Ice batter rammed a family’s car- pulled out machine guns, and took the husband

Caller did not know the person who was taken, was just a witness

WWJ RR is there now with the person that witnessed it. Initial reports are they were pulled over at gun point, keys taken and one person detained. The passenger called the FSN and I believe she’s still on the phone or was when we responded. She said they were rammed from behind, taken out of the car at gunpoint and personal things taken, like the car keys. Seems extreme and possible Nava violations

Update: the car was registered in his name even though she was driving and even though she also has a final order of removal they were only focused on him. 

His immigration case was in NY and yes he had a pending u-visa but it also sounds like his asylum was denied prior to that u-visa.  It could be he already had a removal order
 
ICE did return the keys.  They left them inside the vehicle.

happened Joliet where many undocu ppl live and on a very public main street. A councilwoman saw the whole thing. Seems like they’re also scaring people w these tactics.

Chicago - NWS,,05-14 Chicago - NWS-4001 N Kildare,5/14/2025 5:50pm,Wednesday,8AM-4PM,,"confirmed ICE activity in Irving Park today. Here's the report from folks on the ground ""Report 5/14, 8 Am ish 
Apparently an agent in a black pick up was taling someone in a car they then tried to follow them and force their way into the gated parking lot at 4001 n Kildare. Lucky it seems the resident called ahead and hand someone there ready to quickly close the gate.
Around 8:45 we spoke with a resident at that address who confirmed that there was an ice agent in a black vehicle. 
The 5 DD volunteers huddled made a game plan and then approched the vehicle. We couldn't see the acronym on his vest due to tinted windows but he had a bullet proof vest in military green with yellow lettering. He refused to talk to us, S recorded the incident. He then tried to intimate us with his vehicle during his feeble attempt 3 other civilian cars with tinted windows rolled by us  we suspect they were together because it's not a heavily trafficed street and it seemed coordinated. I followed them for 10 minutes as they circled old iriving park trying to lose me. He eventually got on the express way. We debrief and some folks have committed to canvass and talk to their neighbors.
