Somebody told them that agents had left the parking lot, but were behind the property somewhere. Centro volunteers observed agents in unmarked vehicles talking to each other somewhere near the Aldi at 85th & Holland, and found a large active scene of some sort at the Aldi. The scene at the Aldi involved agents in unmarked vehicles and two ambulances. A marked CPD vehicle eventually showed up briefly and left, but it's not clear if they were involved or if they happened upon the scene at random while on patrol. Centro volunteers also think they saw a news photographer there, but that person left quickly. Centro volunteers observed somebody who looked like an agent getting into the passenger compartment of one of the ambulances when it left the scene. There is photo and video, but one of the Centro volunteers' phones is dead, so it might take a little while to gather all the photo/video and figure out what was going on. They're also asking Aldi staff and parking lot security whether they know anything.

Blue Island RRT responded, confirmed via photos agents in ERO vests. Photo (attached) and video (https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19YZcAx3QD/) later shared on social media. 

From Blue Island RRT: ""It took place right outside Rosa Parks Middle School, but the school was unaware of it when a team member checked in, so it may not have involved a student's family like the caption said. We aren't sure. We have been unable to locate anybody who knows the person taken, and haven't found the car, but we have photo and video from this morning from multiple people that all lines up. The video has a clear look at some of the agents' vehicles.""

Later summary provided in activity chat:

""The Blue Island team (whose co-lead @Sara Oceguera is now in this chat) initially responded when this came in, and the Far South Side team followed up later. There was one person taken outside the school around 8:00AM, identity unknown. We only know for sure that they were taken because their car was left behind - Sara is trying to call in some favors to get family info from the plates so we can inform them and get them connected to resources. This happened on a busy street before the usual school dropoff rush, so we don't know whether it was actually related to the school, but school administrators were made aware of it by a member of the Blue Island team.

At least four agents, some masked and some unmasked, mostly generic ""POLICE"" vests but at least one ERO vest.

10:46 - I just spoke to a high school friend of the kids. Both parents were taken, two kids, both minors, were left with their 18 year old sibling who is undocumented. A 22 year old was   also in the car and was detained but was let go, he's also undocumented. A police officer was there afterward. 
A 22 year old was also detained but was let go. They took the dad and the mom.

We're in conversation with the team - it's a motorcade
Though this report differs somewhat from what they're seeing on the ground. They've got four black luxury SUVs with IL plates - one MP, three regular. Looks like executive transportation of some sort, for Pritzker or another dignitary.
In any case, they have two team members on site and I'll relay updates from their team if any come.
There's a youth baseball game happening, so it just looks like one of the teams has a senator's kid on it or something. The motorcade is just waiting around, there's two additional agents near the stands, looks like a protective setup rather than immigration related. Will continue to update if there's anything specific we find out, and at least one of the BI team members is sticking around to observe.

From RRT signal chat: N893N is a DHS-owned helicopter that's involved in partnership with various local police agencies. In Chicago, it's often used in conjunction with the local-state-federal Vehicular Hijacking Task Force, used to pursue stolen vehicles when the city's own police helicopters are down for refueling or otherwise unavailable. It is unlikely to be immigration related, since it's been around town for several years in coordination with local police activity. However, because it's a federally controlled helicopter, it's not impossible that it could be reassigned for other tasks, so worth keeping an eye on and probably worth the alder asking police contacts whether they know of a coordinated operation with DHS involving that helicopter today",Going from Blue Island to Racine,Rumors,,,,,,,,,,,

WWJ RR is there now with the person that witnessed it. Initial reports are they were pulled over at gun point, keys taken and one person detained. The passenger called the FSN and I believe she’s still on the phone or was when we responded. She said they were rammed from behind, taken out of the car at gunpoint and personal things taken, like the car keys. Seems extreme and possible Nava violations

Update: the car was registered in his name even though she was driving and even though she also has a final order of removal they were only focused on him. 

His immigration case was in NY and yes he had a pending u-visa but it also sounds like his asylum was denied prior to that u-visa.  It could be he already had a removal order

She also checked with apd and they verified verbally that they did not have any activity in the area around that time. However, the person's vehicle was left onsite.
