3:05pm Being reported behind the Food for Less- they are moving through the plaza by cermak/cicero
3:10pm White helicopter coming north just over Pullman
We are hearing they arrested a family /holding someone with a child. RR team is present and there is 15 agents
3:24pm Is that Bovino participating in the arrest? Looks like it to me.
3:10pm There is ice by the Cicero east Rr is on their way to the school only half a mile from Walmart
3:35pm One of our members in Cicero just got threatened with arrest and they threw tear gas at her. ICE is still active in the Cicero Ave/31st area
3:41pm Cicero team needs backup: ICE is circling an elementary school Cicero East on 49th and 23rd Place, team is out there with megaphone. ICE is also going back to the stores: Home Depot, Walmart, Food For Less along Cicero Avenue and 31st (note: creating another report for the school)
3:47pm FSN Voicemail left at 3:47pm Ice just came out of Sam’s club parking lot in Cicero IL on 26th st. They were driving a grey Toyota 4Runner license 
4:01pm Sorry, y'all things are hectic...since our team is at the school support would be best at the stores mentioned in case they come back. We got someone on way to Sams Club but no one at the Food For Less, Walmart or Home Depot. Someone just went to Menards and all clear
4:15pm FSN: Ice sighting, 2803 S. Ave. Inside of the Sam's Club, in Cicero Plaza. Reported as currently making arrests. Unmarked trucks, 6 to 12 agents wearing masks. Wearing olive green tactical uniforms that say ICE.
4:30pm: Walmart employee witnessed it and confirmed they took someone here. Security on duty helped detain the guy according to him...Male, light Hispanic, 35-50yrs old
4:37pm: Verified. Cicero. 48th Ct & 31st. Worker at corner auto shop said a white truck kept circling and detained 1 person about an hour and 20 minutes ago then went to Panda Express
4:42pm Team on ground verified that all agents left from Sam’s/food for less/ Home Depot lot. RRT is canvassing to gather info
4:49pm: Yes that'd be helpful. No one's been able to share a video so far. Spoke to manager, she witnessed all of it according to employees, but she said she couldn't talk about it due to company protocols. I pushed and learned that it's possible wife and daughter were also taken and she mentioned it might be an employee that was off duty, but they are also working on trying to figure out who it was. Quick look around and they definitely have cameras up front, could be a pressure point. It happened right by the market side entrance, between the two sets of sliding doors. Employee I spoke to said he heard a crash and looked over and saw the guy was being pinned to the glass
5:05pm: It would be interesting to know what are the Walmart “protocols” given the security guard helped them in the detention.","3320 S Cicero Ave, Cicero, IL 60804","ICE Sighting,Public Space Raid",,,"Chicago SWS,Cicero/Berwyn,Pilsen,Little Village",1,checked,CE,,"Ford Explorer, Grey, Illinois Plates

Popeyes employees and city workers nearby confirmed they saw agents going after a man at the intersection. He fled on foot and the car was left behind on street. Someone moved it to Popeyes parking lot before RRT arrived. Car was still on, Popeyes employees confirmed they will not call a tow on the car. Since he fled on foot, we are unsure is a detainment was made. We left the car and key at the Popeyes in case he managed to flee and needs to get back home. Address and name found in car was for Uptown. SW team can help getting the car moved to Uptown, but would appreciate help getting in contact with family from Uptown team.

The couple was in a black suv. Sounded like ice, agents had guns, masks and police vests but nothing confirmed. Dropping here just in case is worth reporting to FSN

RRT Followup: Was unable to confirm this. Neighbors didn't see it, but the people who were outside when I arrived were not outside at the time of the incident. Too many black SUVs around for me to confirm the car of the people reported taken or to randomly try door handles.

Update:
CPD showed up. we weren’t able to get the name of the person. And now cpd calling in for towing because it’s suspended -_-

wondering if someone could go to the block the car is registered to and go door to door?

Car has a residential sticker #1811, which is 5300 - 5359 W Drummond Pl

Closest would be Hyde Park - @Mari and crew

There's a couple big lakefront residential complexes in that area, though, so it may be hard to find somebody who knows the car or its owner

Will send to HP team

Apologies, 
That address was for city parking not residential permit parking.

that's the extent of the info so far

FSS checked

thank you @<redacted> (FSS), I asked about cars and whether they are still in the area. Will report back

Not seeing anything here and court security says they didn't see anything, but the parking lot is out of their sight so it's possible something took place out there. There's a transport van here that's used by the court system, but no other obviously suspicious vehicles. If we get more info, that might be helpful.

I can confirm this occurred. Our attorneys spoke to the Sheriffs who observed but no public defender staff saw this. They were gone when we got out there. We will try to identify the person taken based on who was due in court and is missing.
the person was taken inside the court building in the lobby on their way to court.

My understanding is that the court entrance in question is on the west side of the semi-enclosed courtyard across from the entrance to the police station in the same building. Is that correct, or is there a different lobby my team should have eyes on?

I don't have that info but can get it shortly. I am not sure if there is a need for RRT to stay. As far as we can tell, all court abductions have been targeted and the agents have left as soon as they get their person or if they determine that person hasn't come. And our staff said they left immediately (fwiw). Though I did hear about a collateral arrest inside the Will County courthouse.

We're no longer on site right now, just thinking about future plans if we get enough capacity to observe from the courtyard on good weather days or something like that. Feel free to DM me once you know more specifics about the location in the building where this happened.","727 E 111th St, Chicago, IL 60628","ICE Sighting,Rumors",,,Other,,,Alexa Herrera,,,,,,,RRT,,,9/26/2025 1:58am

from FB to our RRT page: sent 2 mins ago. They are currently on 68th between Ashland and marsh field next to family dollar. They have a man in a white work van
Video submitted Team member reports 2 police cars on Ashland. team member reports a blue ford expedition and another team member states that same car has been terrorizing SW. states that he saw agent go from the blue ford to the silver ford and agent took his plate number down. Reports a helicopter in view east of him.
person responding states van is still there and locked and both vehicles are in family dollar lot 68 & Ashland. will avoid driving by lot as agents have seen him circling and have his plate. Magnet school (Miles Davis) at 68 west of Marshfield. Talked to neighbor who will try to ID the van for neighbors to see if anyone knows him/them. Gave KYR card. reports that silver vehicle took pics of him in the car. BOTY team sending help. Person initially detained was let go as he was a citizen. team believes they were asked to leave the parking lot at family dollar, bc they moved the two cars to 68th just before Miguel arrived/ Then multiple other vehicles arrived. For one guy, who is a citizen. Christopher (detainee) told Miguel that they had two Venezuelan brothers in the car prior to him being detained. They seemed to follow him over for no reason (Miguel may have more info on this). The neighbor who he spoke to had walked east down 68th and saw something was wrong. She went west and warned her neighbors that ICE was around, which may be why team didn't see anyone out. She was on her way back when they spoke. Gave her a bit of info and a card. She documented the truck and the card and posted on FB. That's why his family showed up as they were letting him go. Two white folks, male and female spoke with Christopher. He said they were Homeland Security. Maybe bc he was a citizen and then they showed up to clean it all up, note sure. All he can say is they seemed kind (we thought they were attorneys). They can be seen on Miguels video.",68th and Ashland,ICE Sighting,,,Chicago SWS,,checked,Jo Ann,,"Blue Ford Expedition Texas plate RFP 5294.

 Additional Information: The man is inside the court house and confirmed to our lawyer that he is ICE (picture within files below).

Got eyes on an unmarked white police-style SUV with Illinois civilian plates sitting in an alley just north of the intersection. Can't stick around - @Sara-Blue Island Robbins, is there somebody you can send to have eyes on them?

It was a White Ford Explorer, plates started with ER 42...

Could just be somebody with an Explorer that looks similar to a police vehicle, since there weren't others visible nearby, but figured I'd be cautious since a white Explorer with regular IL plates beginning in ER was part of a group of agents the far south side team responded to a few days ago

All clear they prob were u-turning. I drove around a couple of times and another car u turned there. I’m going to drive around both communities just to make sure and team is also aware.

Thanks for the heads up Soren!

2:34pm: 115th & Forest, all standard Illinois plates, claimed ""we're not ICE"" but they have mostly generic police vests and one in a Marshalls vest. They took photos of our team from afar after we questioned them. We're not leaving, keeping eyes on them.

Another video was sent at 12:53

Update on 115th & Forest: agents left around 1PM. They were aware that they were being observed by multiple community members. Several of our responders were photographed from afar by the agents, and when the agents left they split up to avoid being tailed. One sped the wrong way up a one-way street.

A local panaderia across the street was closed for two hours in the middle of this incident, and a nearby school was on high alert.

We believe that the van seen in Dawn Marie's video is unrelated to this incident.

The additional text was sent at 5:07pm on 09/19 - ""This is a follow up from this - a RRT team member who is an attorney followed up with her this afternoon when she was available and she got the full story, sharing here…so far the victim wants to remain anonymous but does want something to be done about it…we are strategizing and welcome input. Here’s what RRT member said:

Hello all, I just spoke with her, very scary encounter and story from her:

She dropped her child off at Oakton Elementary this morning and noticed she was being followed by a black Ford SUV with tinted windows. 

The vehicle followed her to her home - a multi unit rental - and pulled up once she had parked and exited her vehicle (i.e. did not effectuate a traffic stop).

Two officer approached and were wearing dark clothing and bulletproof vests that specified “POLICE.” One of the officers asked her to provide her driver’s license. She told them it was in the mail, as she had just renewed, but assured them it would be valid in any police/DMV system. 

She asked the officers “Did I do anything?” And officers did not provide an answer but asked for ID again. She again assured them it could be looked up on traffic system to verify. They asked if she had any other form of identification to which she responded she had a passport and birth certificate inside her home.

Officers then followed her inside her building and into her apartment unit. Her passport and birth certificate were in her dining room, right in the entry of her home. She provided these documents and the officers inspected them, and asked if anyone else lived there. She told them her son did and provided his birth certificate as well. These documents were readily available in her dining room as she planned to put them in a safety deposit box at the bank. After inspecting these documents, the officers left.

I have advised her on her rights in terms of being stopped outside her home, and constitutional protections that prevent officers warrantless entry into her home. Unfortunately, her allowance into the home - even by way of fear or intimidation - could be considered consent. I also provided information on what she could say and do if this ever happen again - which I certainly hope it does not. It sounds like a very scary interaction and, while we may know our rights or the right things to say, it’s a whole other scenario when faced with unidentified armed officers.

To me, I think local PD would effectuate a traffic stop, rather than wait for her to exit her vehicle - the fact that they didn’t gives me the inkling it could be ICE (because they’re not within their jurisdiction to effectuate a traffic stop). I also do not believe that local PD would so brazenly enter the home, when no articulable criminal circumstances exist, by their own admission. She has concern this could also potentially be vigilantes/non-law enforcement. However, she did not ask what office they were with, or get officers’ names or badge numbers, nor the vehicle license plate. 

I asked her if she needed any additional support to feel safe and supported, she said nothing needed at this time. I told her I would report back to y’all and we would stay in conversation. I also told her, to the extent she is comfortable and has relationships with the other tenants in her building, she should inform them of this encounter and share FSN number.""","Custer Ave & Dobson St, 60202",Rumors,,,Evanston,,checked,CE,,,,,,,External,,🔵 eyJpIjoiQ3VzdGVyIEF2ZSAmIERvYnNvbiBTdCwgNjAyMDIiLCJvIjp7InN0YXR1cyI6Ik9LIiwiZm9ybWF0dGVkQWRkcmVzcyI6IkN1c3RlciBBdmUgJiBEb2Jzb24gU3QsIEV2YW5zdG9uLCBJTCA2MDIwMiwgVVNBIiwibGF0Ijo0Mi4wMjAzMDM4OTk5OTk5OSwibG5nIjotODcuNjgwNDQzNSwiYmxvY2tJbnN0YWxsYXRpb25JZHMiOlsiYmxpclVYaWw5eWtIS0ZBek4iXSwibG9jYXRpb25GaWVsZElkIjoiZmxkcktTemg4VlhKTTFBa0MifSwiZSI6MTc2MTQwODAxOTcxMX0=,9/21/2025 9:58pm

The photos appear to be from behind Ultimate Furniture and Mattress, so safely approaching the folks who live at 7914 Colfax and making clear that you're with RRT (and not ICE) might give you more info, since they probably took the photos. any chance you have direct contact with the people who took the photos?

From Pullman RRT member @ 12:11 pm: ""Updating on this with what we know so far. This was a very chaotic scene. We don't have a clear idea yet what happened. The people who were there when the incident was taking place believe it was ICE, though.Folks from Centro were responding to a tip at the same Home Depot where somebody was taken this morning, on 87th. Somebody told them that agents had left the parking lot, but were behind the property somewhere. Centro volunteers observed agents in unmarked vehicles talking to each other somewhere near the Aldi at 85th & Holland, and found a large active scene of some sort at the Aldi. The scene at the Aldi involved agents in unmarked vehicles and two ambulances. A marked CPD vehicle eventually showed up briefly and left, but it's not clear if they were involved or if they happened upon the scene at random while on patrol. Centro volunteers also think they saw a news photographer there, but that person left quickly. Centro volunteers observed somebody who looked like an agent getting into the passenger compartment of one of the ambulances when it left the scene. There is photo and video, but one of the Centro volunteers' phones is dead, so it might take a little while to gather all the photo/video and figure out what was going on. They're also asking Aldi staff and parking lot security whether they know anything. In the meantime, if anybody has CPD contacts who they can ask to make sure this wasn't a CPD operation, that would be helpful.","200 W 87th Street, Chicago, IL 60620",ICE Sighting,,,Pullman,,checked,Marlyn,,,,,,,"FSN,External",,🔵 eyJpIjoiMjAwIFcgODd0aCBTdHJlZXQsIENoaWNhZ28sIElMIDYwNjIwIiwibyI6eyJzdGF0dXMiOiJPSyIsImZvcm1hdHRlZEFkZHJlc3MiOiIyMDAgVyA4N3RoIFN0LCBDaGljYWdvLCBJTCA2MDYyMCwgVVNBIiwibGF0Ijo0MS43MzcyMDE5LCJsbmciOi04Ny42MzEyMDY2LCJibG9ja0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbklkcyI6WyJibGlyVVhpbDl5a0hLRkF6TiJdLCJsb2NhdGlvbkZpZWxkSWQiOiJmbGRyS1N6aDhWWEpNMUFrQyJ9LCJlIjoxNzYxNDA4MDMyMzk0fQ==,9/18/2025 9:45pm

At 5:50 am today, a group of 40 or 50 men and 20 trucks broke the doors and took three people from a house in Elgin (904 Chippewa Drive ). There were helicopters and drones surrounding the house. One of the enforcement agents said they were border patrol and others were dressed in camouflage but all their clothes and vehicles were unmarked. One of the people arrested was the home owner. One person was a renter so they don't know much about him. The callers are going to continue looking for their A#s and are trying to locate the 3 people.

Blue Island RRT responded, confirmed via photos agents in ERO vests. Photo (attached) and video (https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19YZcAx3QD/) later shared on social media. 

From Blue Island RRT: ""It took place right outside Rosa Parks Middle School, but the school was unaware of it when a team member checked in, so it may not have involved a student's family like the caption said. We aren't sure. We have been unable to locate anybody who knows the person taken, and haven't found the car, but we have photo and video from this morning from multiple people that all lines up. The video has a clear look at some of the agents' vehicles.""

Later summary provided in activity chat:

""The Blue Island team (whose co-lead @Sara Oceguera is now in this chat) initially responded when this came in, and the Far South Side team followed up later. There was one person taken outside the school around 8:00AM, identity unknown. We only know for sure that they were taken because their car was left behind - Sara is trying to call in some favors to get family info from the plates so we can inform them and get them connected to resources. This happened on a busy street before the usual school dropoff rush, so we don't know whether it was actually related to the school, but school administrators were made aware of it by a member of the Blue Island team.

At least four agents, some masked and some unmasked, mostly generic ""POLICE"" vests but at least one ERO vest.

The vehicles involved in the operation were as follows:
White Jeep Grand Cherokee with Indiana plates 266EAW
Navy blue or black Ford Escape (plates unknown)
Black Ford Expedition with Indiana plates B65DAF or B650AF
Black Nissan Titan with Indiana plates [unreadable first character]5480PS

We're in conversation with the team - it's a motorcade
Though this report differs somewhat from what they're seeing on the ground. They've got four black luxury SUVs with IL plates - one MP, three regular. Looks like executive transportation of some sort, for Pritzker or another dignitary.
In any case, they have two team members on site and I'll relay updates from their team if any come.
There's a youth baseball game happening, so it just looks like one of the teams has a senator's kid on it or something. The motorcade is just waiting around, there's two additional agents near the stands, looks like a protective setup rather than immigration related. Will continue to update if there's anything specific we find out, and at least one of the BI team members is sticking around to observe.

I spoke three of the people who were working outside as they’re letting the kids out People doing school safety work. One of them saw them, but he wasn’t close enough to do any real ID. other people hadn’t seen them but just heard reports and they said that people from the school went over to confront them and the posible agents drove away so who knows. I haven’t yet spoken to anybody who has seen them up close. I’ve only spoken to one person who was down the street and said that he saw them.

From RRT signal chat: N893N is a DHS-owned helicopter that's involved in partnership with various local police agencies. In Chicago, it's often used in conjunction with the local-state-federal Vehicular Hijacking Task Force, used to pursue stolen vehicles when the city's own police helicopters are down for refueling or otherwise unavailable. It is unlikely to be immigration related, since it's been around town for several years in coordination with local police activity. However, because it's a federally controlled helicopter, it's not impossible that it could be reassigned for other tasks, so worth keeping an eye on and probably worth the alder asking police contacts whether they know of a coordinated operation with DHS involving that helicopter today",Going from Blue Island to Racine,Rumors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8/1/2025 6:46pm

Ice batter rammed a family’s car- pulled out machine guns, and took the husband

Caller did not know the person who was taken, was just a witness

WWJ RR is there now with the person that witnessed it. Initial reports are they were pulled over at gun point, keys taken and one person detained. The passenger called the FSN and I believe she’s still on the phone or was when we responded. She said they were rammed from behind, taken out of the car at gunpoint and personal things taken, like the car keys. Seems extreme and possible Nava violations

Update: the car was registered in his name even though she was driving and even though she also has a final order of removal they were only focused on him. 

His immigration case was in NY and yes he had a pending u-visa but it also sounds like his asylum was denied prior to that u-visa.  It could be he already had a removal order
 
ICE did return the keys.  They left them inside the vehicle.

happened Joliet where many undocu ppl live and on a very public main street. A councilwoman saw the whole thing. Seems like they’re also scaring people w these tactics.

We couldn't see the acronym on his vest due to tinted windows but he had a bullet proof vest in military green with yellow lettering. He refused to talk to us, S recorded the incident. He then tried to intimate us with his vehicle during his feeble attempt 3 other civilian cars with tinted windows rolled by us  we suspect they were together because it's not a heavily trafficed street and it seemed coordinated. I followed them for 10 minutes as they circled old iriving park trying to lose me. He eventually got on the express way. We debrief and some folks have committed to canvass and talk to their neighbors.
